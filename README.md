# NLP + Game Demo (Unfinished)


# To Complete 

* Better speech-to-text software other than Microsofts SAPI 5.4. A good candidate would be Mozilla's DeepSpeech. 
* FMOD audio engine for recording microphone input to send to the speech-to-text engine. 
* Integrate twitter conversational bot to the game demo to allow player to chat with agent. 
* Train more conversational bots on different datasets. 
* Integrate sentiment analysis python experiments into the game demo and trigger certain game agent behaviours depending 
on the sentiment of the player utterances.
